Concourse is a free and Open Source software project that relies on the contributions of
sponsors and volunteers from around the world. As a growing community of
continuous thing-doers, the team is always in need of more people to help out in our community.

Even if you're just getting started with Concourse you can contribute in
a few ways:

\list{
  \bold{Discuss and Share} your experiences with Concourse in our
  \link{Discord forums}{https://discuss.concourse-ci.org/}
}{
  \bold{Blog about Concourse}. We would love to hear how you got started with Concourse,
  the type of pipelines you're building, or any tips & tricks that you can share with
  the community.
}{
  \bold{Answer questions} about Concourse in the \link{Support}{https://discuss.concourse-ci.org/c/support}
   section of our forums or on \link{Stack Overflow}{https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/concourse}
}

As you become more comfortable with Concourse, you might be interested
in contributing to Concourse's development:
\list{
  \bold{Review issues and report bugs} in the \link{\code{concourse/concourse}}{https://github.com/concourse/concourse/issues}
  repo. We are by no means experts in every subject area; it sometimes takes us
  while to understand a problem space well enough to figure out things fit
  into Concourse's puritanical world. You can help us by:
    \list{
      Voting for issues by adding an emoji reaction to the issue
    }{
      Submitting new bugs when you run into a new problem with Concourse
    }{
      Review GitHub issues submitted by other members of the community; ask for
      (or provide!) clarification when necessary. A lot of the issues that come
      in are simply unclear and we end up spending a lot of time on clarifying issues.
    }
}{
  \bold{Writing Documentation} for the project. You can get started by reviewing
  the docs code at \link{\code{concourse/docs}}{https://github.com/concourse/docs}
  and making PRs against the project.
}{
